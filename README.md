# CS 300 Labs and HW

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/diaboloshogunate/parker-cs300-spring2022/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

I am going to use different libraries/frameworks and tools for the individual assignments to learn more during this class.

## Automation

Automation will be done with githubs actions found in `.github/workflows`.
Right now I am setting up linting. 
I hope to do full gitflow CI/CD by the end of the term but it depends on my workload.

## labs

in class labs will be in `labs` and always the same format at the rest of the class.

## HW
homework will vary more than labs. 
I am wanting to learn additional JS tools and frameworks to decide which one to use for an open source project I am planing.

I will not use supersets of javascript such as typescript and will always include the compiled version. 
Because they make use of chunking, you will need to download the repo and not just the html file.

Below is a list for info on each assignment

| Assignment | Technology | Output file (open in browser) | Inputs (JS source code) | Notes               |
